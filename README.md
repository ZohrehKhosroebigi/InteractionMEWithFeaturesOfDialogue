# InteractionMEWithFeaturesOfDialogue
Through this Github resources, I try to publish the code and data that we have used in our paper "Interaction of motion energy with gesture, extroversion, dominance, and collaboration in dialogue." (https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=LQqQiC4AAAAJ)

This paper analyzes different features of interaction in dialogue and their relations.
 Please note: 
 1) Using Python code to preprocess and generate data for analysis.
 2) Using R code to analyze the results reported in the paper.
